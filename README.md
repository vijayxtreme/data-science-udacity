# Instructions 

## General

Have conda installed (Anaconda/Miniconda).  Install jupyter notebook.  Create a new conda environment with Python2.7, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and seaborn.

You can use this command:

`conda create -n py2_env python=2.7 numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn`

Activate and enter the conda environment in this folder.

Run jupyter notebook in this folder: `jupyter notebook`

Visit the page that opens up and begin working through the examples.

## Dependencies

Be sure to have kernel running on Python2.7 (think it defaults to Python 3).  You'll need to also install unicodecsv, pprint.  In a future update to this, I might add the env file for everything.
